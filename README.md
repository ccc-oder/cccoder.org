# Idea of Hackerspace

A hackerspace (also referred to as a hacklab, hackspace, or makerspace) is a community-operated, often "not for profit" (501(c)(3) in the United States), workspace where people with common interests, such as computers, machining, technology, science, digital art, or electronic art, can meet, socialize, and collaborate.[1] Hackerspaces are comparable to other community-operated spaces with similar aims and mechanisms such as Fab Lab, men's sheds, and commercial "for-profit" companies.

## CCC
The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) is Europe's largest association of hackers[1] with 7700 registered members.[2] Founded in 1981, the association is incorporated as an eingetragener Verein in Germany, with local chapters (called Erfa-Kreise) in various cities in Germany and the surrounding countries, particularly where there are German-speaking communities. Since 1985, some chapters in Switzerland have organized an independent sister association called the Chaos Computer Club Schweiz [de] (CCC-CH) instead.

## Technical Culture

Translation results
Most hackers are more or less related to the hacker culture, but being a hacker is primarily technical skill.
High technical culture results in interesting projects, beneficial in the long term for the local and global community.

## Cel powstania

Odra przepływa przez 3 kraje: Polskę, Niemcy, Czechy, dlatego warto przy pomocy tej naturalnej symboliki wypracować niezależne metody działania ponad granicami różnymi środkami w celu zwiększenia nizależności lokalnej społeczności w sferach technicznych.

> Coding is often seen as an isolating activity. Plenty of groups exist for kids who are interested in sports, theater, or chess, but the stereotype of a programmer is a person who sits alone in a dark room. **It doesn't have to be this way**—in the Hack Club Slack (Discord-style online groupchat), you'll find a group of 20,000+ fabulous people to talk to, active at all hours. For leaders, you'll be able to connect with other leaders and support one another.
